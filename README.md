# Restaurant-Bill-Calculator
A simple restaurant bill calculator program to showcase my c# and win forms skills 

This app uses combo boxes to select menu items.  Once an item is selected it appears in a receipt list box 
and the subtotal, tax, and total are updated.  If an item is placed in the receipt list box by
mistake, the is a remove item buttom.  The bill can also be rest with a clear bill button.

This a great Windows forms exeample for some just learning windows forms, like me.
